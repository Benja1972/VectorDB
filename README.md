# Chroma {#chroma .unnumbered}

[Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/) is the open-source embedding database. Chroma makes it easy to build LLM apps by making knowledge, facts, and skills pluggable for LLMs. Chroma gives you the tools to:

-   store embeddings and their metadata

-   embed documents and queries

-   search embeddings

Chroma prioritizes:

-   simplicity and developer productivity

-   analysis on top of search

-   it also happens to be very quick
